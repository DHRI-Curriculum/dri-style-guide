## How to fix things

You've received a request to fix something? What to do next?

### I can fix it!

Just push more commits to the same branch that you've been working on all along. They will automatically belong to the same pull request.

### It seems like an issue for a later sprint!

Next to the issue that you can't resolve—or think rather belong in a later sprint—open a new issue.

### I am done making revisions

When you're done making revisions to the repository, you can request a new review by pressing the "Re-request review" button next to your reviewers name:
